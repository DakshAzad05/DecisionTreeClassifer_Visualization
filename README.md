# DecisionTreeClassifer_Visualization

This is a streamlit app that represents how a Decision Tree Classifier works on changing various hyperparameters of the model to be trained.
There is a live change in the contour graph and it also provides you with the entire Decision Tree itself.


To run the file on your system, you need to have streamit installed.
If not, you can install it using the command:
